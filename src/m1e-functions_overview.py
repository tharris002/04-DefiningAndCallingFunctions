#   Live in Class:
#
#   Please read the code below and make sure you understand it.
#
#   Immediately below this comment, I have defined a function (that is the
#   block of code that starts with 'def'). Just as words have a definition that
#   explain what a word means or what it is, a block of code can be "defined"
#   to do a certain task or many tasks as the case may be.
#
#   In this case my function just adds the numbers 2 and 3 and prints the
#   result: 5.
#

def add_two_and_three():
    result = 2 + 3
    print(result)

#   Now, if you try to run your code at this point, you will see that nothing
#   gets printed. That is because we haven't "called" the function. We haven't
#   told it to do anything yet, we have just defined it (in other words, we
#   have only told it what it "can" do, but not actually to do it).
#
#   In order to call the function, we need to call it by its name (that is the
#   bit after the def where it says 'add_two_and_three'). That is the
#   function's name. Functions also always have parenteses () after them.
#   Sometimes they will have stuff between the parentheses but this one
#   doesn't. We will take a look at both kinds.
#   
#   Now, to call a function by its name, we simply need to type the name and
#   then the parentheses. That will tell the function to do what it is defined
#   to do.
#
#   You can see below this comment a line of code that does this (except it is
#   commented out). You will need to "un-comment" it. You can do this by either
#   removing the "#" at the beginning of the line, or by clicking anywhere on
#   the line and pressing ctrl+/ or cmd+/ on your keyboard.
#
#   Uncomment the line below and re-run your code. You should now see the
#   number 5 printed in your terminal.
#
#   Make sure you understand these concepts. If you have any questions, please
#   ask them now.
